#Investigate the distribution of the height of Centers and the height of Forwards
#Investigate the if the distribution of height is different between any of the position
#Investigate the relationship between height and weight, how does height change as the weight change
#Is there a H/W relationship for each position
#Investigate the claim that the height of players have incresed over the years
#Create a 3D plot of Height v. Weight v. Year and color code the position
#Go to the website (found in PowerPoint) pick one and provide insight
#Import Education INncome data and test the claim that the mean/median of incomes increase as the education level rises.
