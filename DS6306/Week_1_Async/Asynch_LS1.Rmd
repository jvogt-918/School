## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
n1 = rchisq(n = 50, df =2)
simulations = 10000
```
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
hist(n1, col = "blue", main = paste("Distribution of rchisq"), xlab = "Dist", xlim = c(-5,5))
mean(n1)
sd(n1)
summary(n1)
```

```{r}
xbar_holder1 = numeric(simulations) 
for (i in 1:simulations)
{ 
  sample1 = n1
  xbar1 = mean(sample1)
  xbar_holder1[i] = xbar1
}

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
hist(xbar_holder1, col = "blue", main = paste("Distribution of the sample means"), xlab = "Dist. of Sample Means", xlim = c(-4,4))
summary(xbar_holder1)
sd(xbar_holder1)
```

```{r}
beachcomber_age <- c(25, 19, 37, 29, 40, 28, 31)
t.test(beachcomber_age, mu=21)
```
